Simple FPS widget with vulkan interoperability done.

Next could be:
- Send information about surface size to vulkan API.
	- Currently, vulkan can read the pixel size of the display from the surface, however in other cases like with high DPI monitors, it wont work.
	- UI scaling in windows could be used to test this maybe
- [DONE] spawn/despawn the vulkan window and check that we can attach and detach the instance correctly without memory leaks.
	- Possibility to spawn more than one vulkan viewport!
- Improve the FPS widget. Something like the network traffic plot in wireshark might be cool.
- Docking? Probably too early for that.
- List of shaders in GUI and hotloading in vulkan.
- Refactor MVVM properly. This is important for later. We also need to rename the project, and think of how to package the frontend with the C++ backend
